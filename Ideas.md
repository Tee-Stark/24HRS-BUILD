## Don't Know What To Build?
No worries, we gat you :smile. Here's a list of ideas we feel would be fun to build. 

- A blog app for techies.
- Data management app for hospitals.
- Voting web application.
- Javascript games. Maybe a *snake game*, or even *tic tac toe*, you just make magic.
- A website that gives weather report.
- A CV maker app.
- An app that reminds you of your friends' birthdays and counts down to the day.
- A YouTube clone with just programming videos. Like stackOverFlow with vidoes.
- Chrome extensions.
